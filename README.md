# EZ-Kanban

Fast and furious Kanban Board, built with Golang and React.

This application uses websockets to allow for live updates for changes sent by other clients. `styled-components` was used for style composition. `gorilla/websocket` was
used to provide the server-side websocket functionality.

Rough Demo:
